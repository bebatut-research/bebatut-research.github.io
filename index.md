# Hello

I'm a **bioinformatician** and **computational biologist**.

I am currently a post-doc in the [Freiburg Galaxy Team](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Galaxy/index.html?en) ([Backofen lab, Bioinformatics group](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/index.html?en)), working on several topics (metagenomics, NGS data analyses, evolution) and giving **training**, mainly on [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) use and development of tools. I am highly involved in the development of the [Training Material repository](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/) of the [Galaxy Training Network](https://new.galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/). I am developing numerous tools for Galaxy and packages for [BioConda](http://bioconda.github.io/) to help tool deployment and use. Since February 2017, I am [IUC member](https://new.galaxyproject.org/iuc/). 

During my first post-doc, I worked on the study of gut microbiota using **metagenomic** and **metatranscriptomic** approaches. I developped [ASaiM](http://asaim.github.io/), a bioinformatic environment to study gut microbiota samples with an analysis framework using Galaxy.

During my PhD, I worked on reductive genome evolution of the cyanobacteria *Prochlorococcus*. To study this particular phenomenon, I used two approaches:

- ***In silico*** experimental evolution with the [aevol platform](http://www.aevol.fr/)
- **Comparative genomics** with **phylogeny**

With the combination of these two approaches, I proposed an hypothetic history for the reductive genome evolution of *Prochlorococcus*.
