<br>

I am Bérénice, a **bioinformatician** and **computational biologist**.

I am a post-doc in the in the [Freiburg Galaxy Team](http://galaxyproject.eu/freiburg) ([Backofen lab, Bioinformatics group](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/index.html?en)). I analyze biological data (metagenomics, HTS data, evolution) and develops tools to facilitate data analysis, mainly via [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/). Since February 2017, I am [IUC member](https://new.galaxyproject.org/iuc/). 

I am also passionate about training. I am regularly gives workshops on data analysis, tool development and also as Carpentries instructor. I co-lead the [Galaxy Training Network](https://new.galaxyproject.org/teach/gtn/) effort to develop and maintain a collection of [Galaxy-related training material](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/). I am also the co-deputy of the training coordinator for ELIXIR Germany ([de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de/)).

Because working open is an evidence for me, I join the [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/) and I am now a mentor there, but also for [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

Before, I worked on gut microbiota using **metagenomic** and **metatranscriptomic**. I developped [ASaiM](http://asaim.github.io/), a bioinformatic environment to study gut microbiota samples with an analysis framework using Galaxy. And during my PhD, I worked on reductive genome evolution of the cyanobacteria *Prochlorococcus*. To study this particular phenomenon, I used two approaches:

- ***In silico*** experimental evolution with the [aevol platform](http://www.aevol.fr/)
- **Comparative genomics** with **phylogeny**
