	abstract = {Selon une vision populaire, l{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution serait un processus de {\guillemotleft} progr{\`e}s {\guillemotright} qui s{\textquoteright}accompagnerait d{\textquoteright}un accroissement de la complexit{\'e} mol{\'e}culaire des {\^e}tres vivants. Cependant, les programmes de s{\'e}quen{\c c}age des g{\'e}nomes ont r{\'e}v{\'e}l{\'e} l{\textquoteright}existence d{\textquoteright}esp{\`e}ces dont les lign{\'e}es ont, au contraire, subi une r{\'e}duction massive de leur g{\'e}nome. Ainsi, chez les cyanobact{\'e}ries Prochlorococcus et Pelagibacter ubique, certaines lign{\'e}es ont subi une r{\'e}duction de 30\% de leur g{\'e}nome. Une telle {\'e}volution {\guillemotleft} {\`a} rebours {\guillemotright}, dite {\'e}volution r{\'e}ductive, avait d{\'e}j{\`a} {\'e}t{\'e} observ{\'e}e pour des bact{\'e}ries endosymbiotiques, pour lesquelles la s{\'e}lection naturelle n{\textquoteright}est pas assez efficace pour {\'e}liminer les mutations d{\'e}l{\'e}t{\`e}res comme les pertes de g{\`e}nes. Cela vient notamment du fait que ces bact{\'e}ries endosymbiotiques subissent, {\`a} chaque reproduction de leur h{\^o}te, une r{\'e}duction drastique de leur taille de population. Cette explication semble peu plausible pour des cyanobact{\'e}ries marines comme Prochlorococcus et Pelagibacter, qui ont un mode de vie libre et qui font partie des bact{\'e}ries les plus abondantes des oc{\'e}ans. D{\textquoteright}autres hypoth{\`e}ses ont ainsi {\'e}t{\'e} propos{\'e}es pour expliquer l{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution r{\'e}ductive comme l{\textquoteright}adaptation {\`a} un environnement stable et pauvre en nutriments, des forts taux de mutation, mais aucun de ces hypoth{\`e}ses ne semble capable d{\textquoteright}expliquer toutes les caract{\'e}ristiques g{\'e}nomiques observ{\'e}es. Dans cette th{\`e}se, nous nous int{\'e}ressons au cas de l{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution r{\'e}ductive chez Prochlorococcus, pour laquelle de nombreuses s{\'e}quences et donn{\'e}es sont disponibles. Deux approches sont utilis{\'e}es pour cette {\'e}tude : une analyse phylog{\'e}n{\'e}tique des g{\'e}nomes de Prochlorococcus, et une approche th{\'e}orique de simulation o{\`u} nous testons diff{\'e}rents sc{\'e}narios {\'e}volutifs pouvant conduire {\`a} une {\'e}volution r{\'e}ductive. La combinaison de ces deux approches permet finalement de proposer un sc{\'e}nario plausible pour expliquer l'{\'e}volution r{\'e}ductive chez Prochlorococcus.},

	title = {Simulating evolutionary scenarios to test whether they can induce reductive evolution},
	url = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00762597},
	abstract = {Some bacterial lineages seem to have undergone significant genome shrinkage over the last millions of years, a process called reductive evolution. For example, the genome of Buchnera aphidicola is only one-seventh the size of the genome of its close relative Escherichia coli (Moran and Mira, Genome Biol. 2001). This reductive evolution was initially thought to be a signature of intracellular lifestyle. Thus, explanatory mechanisms related to this lifestyle were proposed, like a smaller effective population size, a lower exposure to horizontal transfer, or the uselessness of some genes. However, reduced genomes were also found in some free-living cyanobacteria like Prochlorococcus marinus (Rocap et al., Nature 2003) or Pelagibacter ubique (Giovannoni et al., Science 2005). This questions the evolutionary mechanisms underlying reductive evolution: Are they shared by endosymbionts and cyanobacteria? Predicting the effect of these mechanisms would shed light on the minimal combination of factors required to observe reductive evolution. We performed in silico evolutionary experiments to test the effect of a smaller population size, a higher mutation rate, a less demanding environment, and a less varying environment. We used the individual-based model aevol (Knibbe et al., Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007), where virtual genomes undergo small-scale mutations, rearrangements, and reproduce differentially based on their performance at a curve-fitting task. Experiments began with ancestral populations that evolved with standard parameters during 150,000 generations. Then the value of the tested parameter was changed and evolution continued for 150,000 additional generations. These simulations showed that a higher mutation rate, as well as a less demanding environment, led to both fewer genes and shorter intergenic sequences. Environmental stabilization triggered reduction in non-coding sequences but not in gene number. Finally, with a smaller population size, some genes were lost but the genome expanded because intergenic sequences lengthened, even with an enforced deletional bias. To explain this surprising effect, one hypothesis is that the sudden reduction in population size leaves a less fit population. The selection, now directional, indirectly favors the most evolvable genomes, that is, genomes with longer non-coding sequences undergoing larger rearrangements. This study is thus a first step towards predicting the genome structure expected for a given evolutionary scenario. The next steps are to (i) further analyze the evolutionary trajectories in these experiments, (ii) test the effect of combined scenarii with multiple changed parameters, and (iii) find the best scenarii for intracellular and free-living species with reduced genomes.},

	abstract = {Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g. coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of {\textasciitilde}35\% with a slight loss of coding sequences ({\textasciitilde}15\% of the genes are lost - mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest). More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a strong reduction of the noncoding compartment ({\textasciitilde}55\% of the noncoding sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is observed in reduced Prochlorococcus strains (marine cyanobacteria) when compared to close relatives.},

	abstract = {Bacterial genomes show substantial variations in size. The smallest bacterial genomes are those of endocellular symbionts of eukaryotic hosts, which have undergone massive genome reduction and show patterns that are consistent with the degenerative processes that are predicted to occur in species with small effective population sizes. However, similar genome reduction is found in some free-living marine cyanobacteria that are characterized by extremely large populations. In this Opinion article, we discuss the different hypotheses that have been proposed to account for this reductive genome evolution at both ends of the bacterial population size spectrum.},
