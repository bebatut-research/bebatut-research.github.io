        summary: >
            With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequencing, 
            biological data are massively generated. Such data are complex and 
            require multi-step processing. While numerous tools exist, most of 
            them are only performing one task, not interoperable, not user-friendly, and 
            so on... That is a big deal for biologists!
            We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a 
            framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for
            biologists: simple yet powerful! 
            In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM, why we chose Python,
            but also what I have learnt developing such a software.
