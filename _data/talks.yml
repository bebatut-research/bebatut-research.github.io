        summary: >
            With the advent of high-throughput platforms, analysis of data in life science is highly 
            linked to the use of bioinformatics tools, resources, and high-performance computing. 
            However, the scientists who generate the data often do not have the knowledge required 
            to be fully conversant with such analyses. To involve them in their own data analysis, 
            these scientists must acquire bioinformatics vocabulary and skills through training.
            Unfortunately, data analysis and its training are particularly challenging without 
            computational background. The Galaxy framework addresses this problem by offering a 
            web-based, intuitive and accessible user interface to numerous bioinformatics tools. It 
            enables sophisticated bioinformatic analysis without requiring life scientists to learn 
            programming, command line interfaces, or systems administration. Trainings based on 
            Galaxy generates significant interest and the number of such events is ever growing, 
            with more than 70 events in 2016. To federate these events and the involved people, the 
            Galaxy Training Network (GTN) was created in 2014. GTN now has 32 member groups and 
            almost 100 individuals.
            Recently, GTN set up a new open, collaborative, online model for delivering high-quality 
            bioinformatics training material: http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material. Each 
            of the current 12 topics provides tutorials with hands-on, slides and interactive tours. 
            Tours are a new way to go through an entire analysis, step by step inside Galaxy in an 
            interactive and explorative way. All material is openly reviewed, and iteratively 
            developed in one central repository by 40 contributors. Content is written in Markdown 
            and, similarly to the Software/Data Carpentry, the model separates presentation from 
            content. It makes easier for community contributions and enables bulk updates and style 
            changes independently of the training content. This is beneficial for the sustainability 
            of this project. In addition, the technological infrastructure needed to teach each topic 
            is also described with an exhaustive list of needed tools. The data (citable via DOI) 
            required for the hands-on, time and resource estimations and flavored Galaxy Docker 
            images are also provided.
            This material is automatically propagated to Elixirâ€™s TeSS portal. With this community 
            effort, the GTN offers an open, collaborative, FAIR and up-to-date infrastructure for 
            delivering high-quality bioinformatics training for scientists.

        summary: >
            Nowadays, massive amounts of diverse data are generated in biomedical research. 
            To manage it and extract useful information, bioinformatic solutions are needed and 
            softwares must be developed. The development of a tool should always follow a similar 
            process. First, to solve a scientific question or a need, some source code is developed, 
            that can be distributed as it is. To help its deployment and ease the usage of the tools, 
            the code is packaged in various package formats. The tool behind the code is then deployed 
            and used by the targeted users. Ideally, documentation, training and support are also provided 
            to help users, spread the solution and advertise it.

            This process, from development to support, is the golden path to develop a good tool. But issues for deployment and 
            sustainability of the tool are found for many bioinformatic tools. What bioinformatician has not dealt with the 
            situation of missing tool dependencies, or an older version of a tool could not be installed due to various reasons. 
            Deployment and sustainability of tools are therefore a major issue for productivity and reproducibility in science.
            
            For deployment issues, we need a package manager that is OS and programming language agnostic, as bioinformatic tools 
            are developed in mostly all available languages and can be used on every major operating systems, including ancient ones. 
            Moreover all available packages have to be permanently cached to be always reachable and enable reproducibility.
            
            Here we describe a community effort to create a flexible, scalable and sustainable system to fix the tool deployment 
            problem once and for all.
            
            Bioconda is a distribution of bioinformatics softwares using Conda, an open source package manager, independent of any 
            programming language and OS. Installation of conda packages are fast and robust. No root privileges are required and 
            multiple versions of every software can be installed and managed in parallel. Helped by an extensive documentation, writing 
            a conda package is very simple, easing the contribution. Thanks to its big and fast-growing community, more than 1,500 bioinformatic 
            packages have been developed in last year. These packages are long-term stored in a public repository (Cargo Port), the distribution 
            center of the Galaxy Project, resolving the sustainability issue. Moreover, a technique called layer donning has been recently 
            introduced to build Docker containers automatically and very efficiently for all conda package.
            
            Development of conda packages through the Bioconda community eases the packaging and the deployment of any bioinformatic tool. 
            The interface with Cargo Port enables sustainability by mirroring all sources. Building efficient Linux containers automatically 
            ensures an even higher layer of abstraction and isolation of the base system. Thanks to these collaborative projects, their 
            community and their collaborations, bioinformatics tools can be easily packaged, deployed and will be always available to help 
            biomedical research.

        summary: >
            Massive sequencing data from intestinal microbiota are available in
            public data repositories (Genbank, ENA, â€¦) but are not easy to identify
            with associated metadata, query and compare because they are dispatched
            and possibly underwent different analyses.
            To extract useful information from these datasets, they need to be
            collected and formatted using a similar workflow based on specific
            gut microbiota databases.
            To process and analyze data from gut microbiota, we developed a framework
            based on a personalized Galaxy instance. In this instance, several tools
            are incorporated (PRINSEQ, FastQ-Join, SortMeRNA, Reago, usearch,
            framebot, cd-hit, MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN, QIIME), with databases such
            as COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) or the catalog of
            reference genes in the human gut  microbiome (Li et al, Nature Biotechnology,
            2014). We defined some standard workflows using these tools and databases.

        summary: >
            With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequencing,
            biological data are massively generated. Such data are complex and
            require multi-step processing. While numerous tools exist, most of
            them are only performing one task, not interoperable, not user-friendly, and
            so on... That is a big deal for biologists!
            We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a
            framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for
            biologists: simple yet powerful!
            In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM, why we chose Python,
            but also what I have learnt developing such a software.

        summary: >
            Metatranscriptomic data allow active
            microbial communities description by gene products analysis. In comparison to
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainageâ€¦) as on human-associated
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible.
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota),
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota.
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/ and
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

        summary: >
            Given a popular view, evolution is an incremental process based on an
            increase of molecular complexity of organisms. However, some organisms
            have undergo massive genome reduction like the endosymbionts. In this
            case the reduction can be explained by the Mullerâ€™s ratchet due to the
            endosymbiont lifestyle with small population and lack of recombination.
            However, in some marine bacteria, like <i>Prochlorococcus</i> et <i>Pelagibacter</i>,
            lineage have undergo up to 30% of genome reduction. Their lifestyle is
            almost the opposite to the one of the endosymbionts and reductive genome
            evolution can not be easily explicable by the Mullerâ€™s ratchet. Some other
            hypothesis has been proposed but none can explain all the observed genomic
             characteristics. In the thesis, I am interested in the reductive
             evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. I used two approaches: a theoretical
             one using simulation where different scenarios are tested and an analysis
             of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> genomes in a phylogenetic framework to determine
             the causes and characteristics of genome reduction. The combination
             of these two approaches allows to propose an hypothetical evolutive
             history for the reductive genome evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>.

        summary: >
            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35%
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost -
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest).
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is
            observed in reduced <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains (marine cyanobacteria)
            when compared to close relatives.
