        summary: >
            Massive sequencing data from intestinal microbiota are available in
            public data repositories (Genbank, ENA, …) but are not easy to identify
            with associated metadata, query and compare because they are dispatched
            and possibly underwent different analyses.
            To extract useful information from these datasets, they need to be
            collected and formatted using a similar workflow based on specific
            gut microbiota databases.
            To process and analyze data from gut microbiota, we developed a framework
            based on a personalized Galaxy instance. In this instance, several tools
            are incorporated (PRINSEQ, FastQ-Join, SortMeRNA, Reago, usearch,
            framebot, cd-hit, MetaPhlAn, HUMAnN, QIIME), with databases such
            as COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) or the catalog of
            reference genes in the human gut  microbiome (Li et al, Nature Biotechnology,
            2014). We defined some standard workflows using these tools and databases.

        summary: >
            With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequencing,
            biological data are massively generated. Such data are complex and
            require multi-step processing. While numerous tools exist, most of
            them are only performing one task, not interoperable, not user-friendly, and
            so on... That is a big deal for biologists!
            We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a
            framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for
            biologists: simple yet powerful!
            In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM, why we chose Python,
            but also what I have learnt developing such a software.

        summary: >
            Metatranscriptomic data allow active
            microbial communities description by gene products analysis. In comparison to
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible.
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota),
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota.
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/ and
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

            Le microbiote intestinal humain permet de
            prévenir les infections, de stimuler l’immunité ou encore de réduire les
            inflammations. La réduction des coûts de séquençage de l’ADN permet d’étudier
            plus facilement ces microorganismes. Cependant, ces techniques génèrent de
            grandes quantités de données qui sont complexes à analyser, surtout pour les
            biologistes. La plateforme Auvergne Sequence Analyses of Intestinal Microbiota
            (ASAIM) est développée afin d’offrir une solution à ces problématiques.

        title: "Evolution réductive des génomes bactériens par expériences d'évolution <i>in silico</i> et analyses bioinformatiques"

        summary: >
            Given a popular view, evolution is an incremental process based on an
            increase of molecular complexity of organisms. However, some organisms
            have undergo massive genome reduction like the endosymbionts. In this
            case the reduction can be explained by the Muller’s ratchet due to the
            endosymbiont lifestyle with small population and lack of recombination.
            However, in some marine bacteria, like <i>Prochlorococcus</i> et <i>Pelagibacter</i>,
            lineage have undergo up to 30% of genome reduction. Their lifestyle is
            almost the opposite to the one of the endosymbionts and reductive genome
            evolution can not be easily explicable by the Muller’s ratchet. Some other
            hypothesis has been proposed but none can explain all the observed genomic
             characteristics. In the thesis, I am interested in the reductive
             evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. I used two approaches: a theoretical
             one using simulation where different scenarios are tested and an analysis
             of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> genomes in a phylogenetic framework to determine
             the causes and characteristics of genome reduction. The combination
             of these two approaches allows to propose an hypothetical evolutive
             history for the reductive genome evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>.

        summary: >
            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35%
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost -
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest).
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is
            observed in reduced <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains (marine cyanobacteria)
            when compared to close relatives.
