        summary: >
            With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequencing, 
            biological data are massively generated. Such data are complex and 
            require multi-step processing. While numerous tools exist, most of 
            them are only performing one task, not interoperable, not user-friendly, and 
            so on... That is a big deal for biologists!
            We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a 
            framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for
            biologists: simple yet powerful! 
            In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM, why we chose Python,
            but also what I have learnt developing such a software.

        summary: >
            Metatranscriptomic data allow active 
            microbial communities description by gene products analysis. In comparison to 
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on 
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated 
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in 
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data 
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics 
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible. 
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota), 
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota. 
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments 
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more 
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects 
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate 
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance 
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This 
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing 
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and 
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/ and 
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

            Le microbiote intestinal humain permet de 
            prévenir les infections, de stimuler l’immunité ou encore de réduire les 
            inflammations. La réduction des coûts de séquençage de l’ADN permet d’étudier 
            plus facilement ces microorganismes. Cependant, ces techniques génèrent de 
            grandes quantités de données qui sont complexes à analyser, surtout pour les 
            biologistes. La plateforme Auvergne Sequence Analyses of Intestinal Microbiota 
            (ASAIM) est développée afin d’offrir une solution à ces problématiques.
