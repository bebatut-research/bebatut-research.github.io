        title: "ASaiM: a Galaxy-based framework to analyse raw shotgun data from microbiota"
        year: 
        authors: "Batut B, Defois C, Gravouil K et al"
        journal: "Submitted - Preprint to BioRxiv"
        doi: 10.1101/183970
        ref:

        summary: >
            New generation of sequencing platforms coupled to numerous bioinformatics tools has led 
            to rapid technological progress in metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to investigate 
            complex microorganism communities. Nevertheless, a combination of different bioinformatic 
            tools remains necessary to draw conclusions out of microbiota studies. Modular and 
            user-friendly tools would greatly improve such studies. We therefore developed ASaiM, 
            an Open-Source Galaxy-based framework dedicated to microbiota data analyses. ASaiM 
            provides a curated collection of tools to explore and visualize taxonomic and functional 
            information from raw amplicon, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequences. To guide 
            different analyses, several customizable workflows are included. All workflows are 
            supported by tutorials and Galaxy interactive tours to guide the users through the 
            analyses step by step. ASaiM is implemented as Galaxy Docker flavour. It is scalable to 
            many thousand datasets, but also can be used a normal PC. The associated source code is 
            available under Apache 2 license at https://github.com/ASaiM/framework and documentation 
            can be found online (http://asaim.readthedocs.io/). Based on the Galaxy framework, ASaiM 
            offers sophisticated analyses to scientists without command-line knowledge. ASaiM provides 
            a powerful framework to easily and quickly explore microbiota data in a reproducible and 
            transparent environment.

        title: "ENASearch: A Python library for interacting with ENA's API"
        year: 2017
        authors: "Batut B & Grüning B"

        summary: >
            The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a database with a 
            comprehensive record of nucleotide sequencing information (raw sequencing data, sequence 
            assembly information and functional annotation). The data contained in ENA can be accessed 
            manually or programmatically via REST URLs. However, building HTTP-based REST requests 
            is not always straightforward - a user friendly, high-level access is needed to make it 
            easier to interact with ENA programmatically.
            We developed ENASearch, a Python library to search and retrieve data from ENA database. 
            It also allows for rich querying support by accessing different fields, filters or functions 
            offered by ENA. ENASearch can be used as a Python package, through a command-line interface 
            or inside Galaxy.

        title: "Environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene impacts the volatile metabolome and transcriptome of the human gut microbiota"
        year: 2017
        authors: "Defois C, Ratel J, Denis S, Batut B et al"
        journal: "Front. Microbiol."
        doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2017.01562
        ref: 8, 1562
        link: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01562
        summary: >
            Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is a ubiquitous, persistent, and carcinogenic pollutant that 
            belongs to the large family of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Population exposure 
            primarily occurs via contaminated food products, which introduces the pollutant to the 
            digestive tract. Although the metabolism of B[a]P by host cells is well known, its 
            impacts on the human gut microbiota, which plays a key role in health and disease, 
            remain unexplored. We performed an in vitro assay using 16S barcoding, metatranscriptomics 
            and volatile metabolomics to study the impact of B[a]P on two distinct human fecal 
            microbiota. B[a]P exposure did not induce a significant change in the microbial structure; 
            however, it altered the microbial volatolome in a dose-dependent manner. The transcript 
            levels related to several metabolic pathways, such as vitamin and cofactor metabolism, 
            cell wall compound metabolism, DNA repair and replication systems, and aromatic compound 
            metabolism, were upregulated, whereas the transcript levels related to the 
            glycolysis-gluconeogenesis pathway and bacterial chemotaxis toward simple carbohydrates 
            were downregulated. These primary findings show that food pollutants, such as B[a]P, 
            alter human gut microbiota activity. The observed shift in the volatolome demonstrates 
            that B[a]P induces a specific deviation in the microbial metabolism.

        summary: >
            Scientific research relies on computer software, yet software is not always developed 
            following practices that ensure its quality and sustainability. This manuscript does 
            not aim to propose new software development best practices, but rather to provide 
            simple recommendations that encourage the adoption of existing best practices. Software 
            development best practices promote better quality software, and better quality software 
            improves the reproducibility and reusability of research. These recommendations are 
            designed around Open Source values, and provide practical suggestions that contribute 
            to making research software and its source code more discoverable, reusable and 
            transparent. This manuscript is aimed at developers, but also at organisations, 
            projects, journals and funders that can increase the quality and sustainability of 
            research software by encouraging the adoption of these recommendations.

        summary: >
            RNA-based regulation has become a major research topic in molecular biology. 
            The analysis of epigenetic and expression data is therefore incomplete if RNA-based 
            regulation is not taken into account. Thus, it is increasingly important but not yet 
            standard to combine RNA-centric data and analysis tools with other types of experimental 
            data such as RNA-seq or ChIP-seq. Here, we present the RNA workbench, a comprehensive 
            set of analysis tools and consolidated workflows that enable the researcher to combine 
            these two worlds. Based on the Galaxy framework the workbench guarantees simple access, 
            easy extension, flexible adaption to personal and security needs, and sophisticated 
            analyses that are independent of command-line knowledge. Currently, it includes more 
            than 50 bioinformatics tools that are dedicated to different research areas of RNA 
            biology including RNA structure analysis, RNA alignment, RNA annotation, RNA-protein 
            interaction, ribosome profiling, RNA-seq analysis and RNA target prediction. The 
            workbench is developed and maintained by experts in RNA bioinformatics and the Galaxy 
            framework. Together with the growing community evolving around this workbench, we are 
            committed to keep the workbench up-to-date for future standards and needs, providing 
            researchers with a reliable and robust framework for RNA data analysis. Availability:

        summary: >
            Bacterial genomes show substantial variations in size. The smallest
            bacterial genomes are those of endocellular symbionts of eukaryotic
            hosts, which have undergone massive genome reduction and show patterns
             that are consistent with the degenerative processes that are predicted
             to occur in species with small effective population sizes. However,
             similar genome reduction is found in some free-living marine
             cyanobacteria that are characterized by extremely large populations.
            In this Opinion article, we discuss the different hypotheses that have
            been proposed to account for this reductive genome evolution at both
            ends of the bacterial population size spectrum.

        summary: >
            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35%
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost -
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest).
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is
            observed in reduced <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains (marine cyanobacteria)
            when compared to close relatives.

            With the advent of high-throughput platforms, analysis of data in life science is highly 
            linked to the use of bioinformatics tools, resources, and high-performance computing. 
            However, the scientists who generate the data often do not have the knowledge required 
            to be fully conversant with such analyses. To involve them in their own data analysis, 
            these scientists must acquire bioinformatics vocabulary and skills through training.
            Unfortunately, data analysis and its training are particularly challenging without 
            computational background. The Galaxy framework addresses this problem by offering a 
            web-based, intuitive and accessible user interface to numerous bioinformatics tools. It 
            enables sophisticated bioinformatic analysis without requiring life scientists to learn 
            programming, command line interfaces, or systems administration. Trainings based on 
            Galaxy generates significant interest and the number of such events is ever growing, 
            with more than 70 events in 2016. To federate these events and the involved people, the 
            Galaxy Training Network (GTN) was created in 2014. GTN now has 32 member groups and 
            almost 100 individuals.
            Recently, GTN set up a new open, collaborative, online model for delivering high-quality 
            bioinformatics training material: http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material. Each 
            of the current 12 topics provides tutorials with hands-on, slides and interactive tours. 
            Tours are a new way to go through an entire analysis, step by step inside Galaxy in an 
            interactive and explorative way. All material is openly reviewed, and iteratively 
            developed in one central repository by 40 contributors. Content is written in Markdown 
            and, similarly to the Software/Data Carpentry, the model separates presentation from 
            content. It makes easier for community contributions and enables bulk updates and style 
            changes independently of the training content. This is beneficial for the sustainability 
            of this project. In addition, the technological infrastructure needed to teach each topic 
            is also described with an exhaustive list of needed tools. The data (citable via DOI) 
            required for the hands-on, time and resource estimations and flavored Galaxy Docker 
            images are also provided.
            This material is automatically propagated to Elixir’s TeSS portal. With this community 
            effort, the GTN offers an open, collaborative, FAIR and up-to-date infrastructure for 
            delivering high-quality bioinformatics training for scientists.

        summary: >
            Nowadays, massive amounts of diverse data are generated in biomedical research. 
            To manage it and extract useful information, bioinformatic solutions are needed and 
            softwares must be developed. The development of a tool should always follow a similar 
            process. First, to solve a scientific question or a need, some source code is developed, 
            that can be distributed as it is. To help its deployment and ease the usage of the tools, 
            the code is packaged in various package formats. The tool behind the code is then deployed 
            and used by the targeted users. Ideally, documentation, training and support are also provided 
            to help users, spread the solution and advertise it.

            This process, from development to support, is the golden path to develop a good tool. But issues for deployment and 
            sustainability of the tool are found for many bioinformatic tools. What bioinformatician has not dealt with the 
            situation of missing tool dependencies, or an older version of a tool could not be installed due to various reasons. 
            Deployment and sustainability of tools are therefore a major issue for productivity and reproducibility in science.
            
            For deployment issues, we need a package manager that is OS and programming language agnostic, as bioinformatic tools 
            are developed in mostly all available languages and can be used on every major operating systems, including ancient ones. 
            Moreover all available packages have to be permanently cached to be always reachable and enable reproducibility.
            
            Here we describe a community effort to create a flexible, scalable and sustainable system to fix the tool deployment 
            problem once and for all.
            
            Bioconda is a distribution of bioinformatics softwares using Conda, an open source package manager, independent of any 
            programming language and OS. Installation of conda packages are fast and robust. No root privileges are required and 
            multiple versions of every software can be installed and managed in parallel. Helped by an extensive documentation, writing 
            a conda package is very simple, easing the contribution. Thanks to its big and fast-growing community, more than 1,500 bioinformatic 
            packages have been developed in last year. These packages are long-term stored in a public repository (Cargo Port), the distribution 
            center of the Galaxy Project, resolving the sustainability issue. Moreover, a technique called layer donning has been recently 
            introduced to build Docker containers automatically and very efficiently for all conda package.
            
            Development of conda packages through the Bioconda community eases the packaging and the deployment of any bioinformatic tool. 
            The interface with Cargo Port enables sustainability by mirroring all sources. Building efficient Linux containers automatically 
            ensures an even higher layer of abstraction and isolation of the base system. Thanks to these collaborative projects, their 
            community and their collaborations, bioinformatics tools can be easily packaged, deployed and will be always available to help 
            biomedical research.

            Metatranscriptomic data allow active microbial communities description
            by gene products analysis. In comparison to
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible.
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota),
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota.
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at
            <a href="http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/">http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/</a> and
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

        summary: >
            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35%
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost -
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest).
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is
            observed in reduced <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains (marine cyanobacteria)
            when compared to close relatives.

        summary: >
            The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a major threat to
            public health and there is a constant need for education to limit
            dangerous practices. Here, we propose to use alife software to develop
            training media for the public and the physicians. On the basis of the
             Aevol model we have been developing for more than six years, we built
             a game in which players fight bacterial infections using antibiotics.
             In this game the bacteria can evolve resistance traits, making the
             infection more and more difficult to cure. The game has been tested
             with automatic treatment procedures, showing that it behaves correctly.
             It has been demonstrated during the French "Nuit des Chercheurs" in
             October 2012.

        summary: >
            Given a popular view, evolution is an incremental process based on an
            increase of molecular complexity of organisms. However, some organisms
            have undergo massive genome reduction like the endosymbionts. In this
            case the reduction can be explained by the Muller’s ratchet due to the
            endosymbiont lifestyle with small population and lack of recombination.
            However, in some marine bacteria, like <i>Prochlorococcus</i> et <i>Pelagibacter</i>,
            lineage have undergo up to 30% of genome reduction. Their lifestyle is
            almost the opposite to the one of the endosymbionts and reductive genome
            evolution can not be easily explicable by the Muller’s ratchet. Some other
            hypothesis has been proposed but none can explain all the observed genomic
             characteristics. In the thesis, I am interested in the reductive
             evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. I used two approaches: a theoretical
             one using simulation where different scenarios are tested and an analysis
             of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> genomes in a phylogenetic framework to determine
             the causes and characteristics of genome reduction. The combination
             of these two approaches allows to propose an hypothetical evolutive
             history for the reductive genome evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>.

            With the advent of high-throughput platforms, life science data analysis is tightly linked 
            to the use of bioinformatics tools, resources, and high-performance computing. However, 
            the scientists who generate the data often do not have the knowledge required to be fully

            must acquire bioinformatics vocabulary and skills through training.
            Data analysis training is particularly challenging without a computational background. 
            The Galaxy framework is addressing this problem by offering a web-based, intuitive and

            Recently, the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) set up a new open, collaborative, online model

            Each of the current 13 topics provides tutorials with hands-on, slides and interactive

            with a list of needed tools, annotation of public Galaxy instances and Docker images for 
            each topic. The data are also stored in Zenodo and citable via DOI.
            All materials are annotated by a rich set of metadata (time and resource estimations) and

        summary: >
            The study of microbial communities has been facilitated by the evolution of sequencing 
            techniques and the development of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. These techniques 
            are giving insight into phylogenetic properties and metabolic components of microbial 
            communities. However, meta'omic data exploitation is not trivial: large amount of data, 
            high variability, incompleteness of reference databases, difficulty to find, configure, 
            use and combine the dedicated bioinformatics tools, etc. Hence, to extract useful 
            information, a sequenced microbiota sample has to be processed by sophisticated workflows 
            with numerous successive bioinformatics steps. Besides, bioinformatics tools are often 
            manually executed and/or patched together with custom scripts. These practices raise doubts 
            about a science gold standard: reproducibility. Alternative approaches to improve 
            accessibility, modularity and reproducibility can be found in Open-Source workflow systems 
            such as Galaxy. Galaxy is a lightweight environment providing a web-based, intuitive and 
            accessible user interface to command-line tools, while automatically managing computation 
            and transparently managing data provenance and workflow scheduling. In this context, we 
            developed ASaiM, an Open-Source opinionated Galaxy-based framework.
            ASaiM provides an expertly selected collection of tools to exploit and visualize taxonomic 
            and functional information from raw amplicon, metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequences. 
            To help the analyses, several (customizable) workflows are included. The workflow for 
            shotgun metagenomic data has been tested on two mock metagenomic datasets with controlled 
            communities. More accurate and precise taxonomic analyses and more informative metabolic 
            description have been obtained compared to EBI metagenomics' pipeline on the same datasets.
            The available workflows are supported by tutorials and Galaxy interactive tours to guide 
            the users through the analyses. Furthermore, an effort on documentation of ASaiM, its 
            tools and workflows has been made (http://asaim.readthedocs.io).
            Based on the Galaxy framework, ASaiM offers sophisticated analyses to scientists without 
            command-line knowledge, while emphasizing reproducibility, customization and effortless 
            scale up to larger infrastructures. ASaiM is implemented as Galaxy Docker flavour and 
            can be easily extended with additional tools or workflows. ASaiM provides then a powerful 
            framework to easily and quickly exploit microbiota data in a reproducible and transparent 
            environment.

        summary: >
            Scalability is a key challenge in bioinformatics. Data management, analysis pipelines, 
            compute infrastructure, visualisations, and training must all scale to address ever-larger 
            experimental designs, and the increasing prevalence of data-intensive life science 
            research. ELIXIR, GOBLET, and the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) have teamed up to create 
            reusable and community extensible bioinformatics training materials, available online 
            for individual life science researchers and trainers.
            Thanks to this community led effort, a series of Galaxy-based tutorials were developed to 
            teach numerous data analysis topics, ranging from genomics to proteomics to metabolomics. 
            Training on Galaxy administration and development is also included in this effort. The 
            content is developed in Markdown, stored in GitHub and separated from the presentation 
            on the website, facilitating its development and updating by the community. The 
            technological infrastructure needed to teach is provided with Docker images for each 
            topic and the datasets are stored in Zenodo with assigned DOIs. All materials are 
            annotated by a rich set of metadata and automatically propagated to ELIXIR’s TeSS portal. 
            This approach creates tutorials that are accessible, easy to find and use (FAIR) by 
            individuals and by trainers for workshops.
            This poster highlights the approach taken, how it addresses the scalability of presenting, 
            creating, and maintaining training materials, as well as the resulting products. We will 
            also report on the the recently held ELIXIR/GOBLET/GTN hackathon for Galaxy training 
            material re-use and the community’s future plans.

        summary: >
            Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous persistent
            pollutants arising from oil and derivatives along with incomplete
            organic matter combustion. The latter including both anthropogenic
            (engine exhausts, domestic heating, tobacco smoke, some cooking
            practices) and natural sources (forest fires, volcanism). Population
            exposure occurs mainly with contaminated food products, leading
            pollutants to end up in the digestive tract. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P),
            being the most studied PAH due to its high mutagenic and carcinogenic
            properties, has been chosen as marker of PAH occurrence and toxicity.
            While its metabolism by host cells is well known, the impact on the
            gut microbiota, which play a key role in human health is still
            unexplored. By means of 16S barcoding, metatranscriptomics and
            volatile metabolomics, we studied, in an in vitro model assay, the
            impact of B[a]P on two distinct gut microbiota. B[a]P didn’t induce
            a significant change of the microbial structure but some slight
            modifications appeared as the increase of the genera Sutterella,
            Sporanaerobacter and Oscillospira and the reduction of Rikenellaceae
            and Blautia. B[a]P exposure alters the microbial volatile metabolome
            dose-dependently. While the two studied microbiota structures were
            clearly apart, their metabolic response was rather similar.
            Metatranscriptomes revealed that several functional pathways were up
            regulated such as DNA repair systems, cell wall compound biogenesis
            and vitamins and cofactors metabolism and others down regulated as
            the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis pathway and the bacterial chemotaxis
            towards simple carbohydrates. Those primary findings shows that food
            pollutants, such as B[a]P, may interfere with the human gut
            microbiota activity. This interplay should then be highlighted to
            understand if such changes are related to gut homeostasis maintenance
            in a protective response against chemical pollutants or could
            contribute to functional dysbiosis in relation to pathologies.

            and the reduction of <i>Rikenellaceae</i> and <i>Blautia</i>. Some functional pathways
            were heighten such as protein export, secretion systems, cell wall compound
            biogenesis, DNA repair systems and hydrocarbon degradation pathways.
            Furthermore, the microbial volatile metabolome was altered. Those primary
            findings showed that food pollutants, such as B[a]P, may modify our gut
            microbiota and could contribute to disturb the gut homeostasis.

        summary: >
            Some bacterial lineages seem to have undergone significant genome shrinkage
            over the last millions of years, a process called reductive evolution.
            For example, the genome of <i>Buchnera aphidicola</i> is only one-seventh
            the size of the genome of its close relative <i>Escherichia coli</i>
            (Moran and Mira, Genome Biol. 2001). This reductive evolution was initially
             thought to be a signature of intracellular lifestyle. Thus, explanatory
            mechanisms related to this lifestyle were proposed, like a smaller
            effective population size, a lower exposure to horizontal transfer,
            or the uselessness of some genes. However, reduced genomes were also
            found in some free-living cyanobacteria like <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>
            (Rocap et al., Nature 2003) or <i>Pelagibacter ubique</i> (Giovannoni
            et al., Science 2005). This questions the evolutionary mechanisms underlying
             reductive evolution: Are they shared by endosymbionts and cyanobacteria?
            Predicting the effect of these mechanisms would shed light on the minimal
            combination of factors required to observe reductive evolution. We performed
            <i>in silico</i> evolutionary experiments to test the effect of a smaller
            population size, a higher mutation rate, a less demanding environment,
            and a less varying environment. We used the individual-based model aevol
            (Knibbe et al., Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007), where virtual genomes undergo
            small-scale mutations, rearrangements, and reproduce differentially
            based on their performance at a curve-fitting task. Experiments began
            with ancestral populations that evolved with standard parameters during
            150,000 generations. Then the value of the tested parameter was changed
            and evolution continued for 150,000 additional generations. These simulations
             showed that a higher mutation rate, as well as a less demanding environment,
             led to both fewer genes and shorter intergenic sequences. Environmental
            stabilization triggered reduction in non-coding sequences but not in gene
            number. Finally, with a smaller population size, some genes were lost
            but the genome expanded because intergenic sequences lengthened, even
            with an enforced deletional bias. To explain this surprising effect,
            one hypothesis is that the sudden reduction in population size leaves
            a less fit population. The selection, now directional, indirectly favors
             the most evolvable genomes, that is, genomes with longer non-coding
             sequences undergoing larger rearrangements. This study is thus a first
            step towards predicting the genome structure expected for a given evolutionary
            scenario. The next steps are to (i) further analyze the evolutionary
            trajectories in these experiments, (ii) test the effect of combined
            scenarii with multiple changed parameters, and (iii) find the best scenarii
            for intracellular and free-living species with reduced genomes.

        title: "Tracing the roots of genome architecture through <i>in silico</i> experimental evolution"
        authors: "Beslon G, Batut B, Knibbe C"
        conf: "EMBO Conference Series: Experimental Approaches to Evolution and Ecology using Yeast and other Model Systems"
        when: "Oct 2014"

        summary: >
            Genome architecture (size, proportion of coding sequences, polycistronic
            mRNAs…) is the consequence of many interacting forces acting over very
             long time scales. Indeed, selection, mutation biases, drift etc. all
             act directly or indirectly on the different genome compartments, either
             triggering their increase or decrease in proportions that depend on the
            life style of the organisms (e.g., environment complexity, environment
            variation, population size…).
            Understanding how the intertwining of these pressures leads to particular
            architecture is difficult for at least three reasons. First, it is
            impossible to experimentally separate these forces to observe their
            individual action since they are all interacting one with the others
            at the molecular level. Second, they act on time scales that are almost
            impossible to access experimentally, even with species reproducing rapidly.
            Third, it is not clear how a given change of life-style will affect
            these different pressures.
            We propose that <i>in silico</i> experimental evolution approaches, in which
            simulated species are let evolved in perfectly controlled (simulated)
            environments, can be used to study the consequences of a specific change
            in life-style on the genome architecture. Indeed, <i>in silico</i> experiments
            can escape most of the difficulties listed above: since the organisms
            and environment are simulated, they can be precisely tuned, millions of
             generations can “easily” be simulated and, most importantly, it allows
            large parameter explorations that can help understanding the precise
            effect of a given environmental parameter on a given genomic structure.
            We illustrate the power of in silico experimental evolution using the
            aevol software (<a href="www.aevol.fr">www.aevol.fr</a>). We show how different environmental
            changes can lead to unexpected consequences on the genome structure
            due to the non-linearity of the selective/non-selective pressures. In
            particular, we emphasize the overlooked effect of chromosomal rearrangements
            on this matter.
