            Bacterial genomes show substantial variations in size. The smallest 
            bacterial genomes are those of endocellular symbionts of eukaryotic 
            hosts, which have undergone massive genome reduction and show patterns
             that are consistent with the degenerative processes that are predicted
             to occur in species with small effective population sizes. However,
             similar genome reduction is found in some free-living marine 
             cyanobacteria that are characterized by extremely large populations. 
            In this Opinion article, we discuss the different hypotheses that have 
            been proposed to account for this reductive genome evolution at both 
            ends of the bacterial population size spectrum.

            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional 
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species 
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic 
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these 
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many 
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes 
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection 
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary 
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to 
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on 
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this 
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35% 
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost - 
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest). 
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a 
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding 
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is 
            observed in reduced Prochlorococcus strains (marine cyanobacteria) 
            when compared to close relatives.

            Metatranscriptomic data allow active 
            microbial communities description by gene products analysis. In comparison to 
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on 
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated 
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in 
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data 
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics 
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible. 
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota), 
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota. 
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments 
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more 
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects 
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate 
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance 
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This 
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing 
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and 
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/ and 
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

        summary: >
            The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a major threat to 
            public health and there is a constant need for education to limit 
            dangerous practices. Here, we propose to use alife software to develop 
            training media for the public and the physicians. On the basis of the
             Aevol model we have been developing for more than six years, we built
             a game in which players fight bacterial infections using antibiotics.
             In this game the bacteria can evolve resistance traits, making the 
             infection more and more difficult to cure. The game has been tested
             with automatic treatment procedures, showing that it behaves correctly.
             It has been demonstrated during the French "Nuit des Chercheurs" in
             October 2012.

        summary: >
            Given a popular view, evolution is an incremental process based on an 
            increase of molecular complexity of organisms. However, some organisms 
            have undergo massive genome reduction like the endosymbionts. In this 
            case the reduction can be explained by the Muller’s ratchet due to the 
            endosymbiont lifestyle with small population and lack of recombination. 
            However, in some marine bacteria, like Prochlorococcus et Pelagibacter, 
            lineage have undergo up to 30% of genome reduction. Their lifestyle is 
            almost the opposite to the one of the endosymbionts and reductive genome 
            evolution can not be easily explicable by the Muller’s ratchet. Some other 
            hypothesis has been proposed but none can explain all the observed genomic
             characteristics. In the thesis, I am interested in the reductive 
             evolution of Prochlorococcus. I used two approaches: a theoretical 
             one using simulation where different scenarios are tested and an analysis 
             of Prochlorococcus genomes in a phylogenetic framework to determine 
             the causes and characteristics of genome reduction. The combination 
             of these two approaches allows to propose an hypothetical evolutive 
             history for the reductive genome evolution of Prochlorococcus.
