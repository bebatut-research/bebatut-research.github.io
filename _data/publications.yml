            With new generation sequencing platforms, huge amounts of short reads are produced. Inappropriate
            use of sequence analysis procedures may result in misinterpretation and error propagation. This
            is particularly true for the analyses of complex microorganism communities. Modular, accessible and sharable
            user-friendly tools are then urgently needed to conduct efficient and reproducible analyses to explore
            microbiota data.
            We developed ASaiM, an open-source Galaxy-based framework dedicated to assist in the microbiota
            data analyses. It provides an expertly selected collection of tools, (customizable) workflows and databases
            to focus specifically on the exploitation of taxonomic and metabolic information from raw metagenomic
            and metatranscriptomic sequences. ASaiM provides a powerful framework to easily and quickly
            exploit microbiota data in a reproducible and transparent environment

            Bacterial genomes show substantial variations in size. The smallest
            bacterial genomes are those of endocellular symbionts of eukaryotic
            hosts, which have undergone massive genome reduction and show patterns
             that are consistent with the degenerative processes that are predicted
             to occur in species with small effective population sizes. However,
             similar genome reduction is found in some free-living marine
             cyanobacteria that are characterized by extremely large populations.
            In this Opinion article, we discuss the different hypotheses that have
            been proposed to account for this reductive genome evolution at both
            ends of the bacterial population size spectrum.

            Comparative genomics has revealed that some species have exceptional
            genomes, compared to their closest relatives. For instance, some species
            have undergone a strong reduction of their genome with a drastic
            reduction of their genic repertoire. Deciphering the causes of these
            atypical trajectories can be very difficult because of the many
            phenomena that are intertwined during their evolution (e.g. changes
            of population size, environment structure and dynamics, selection
            strength, mutation rates...). Here we propose a methodology based on
             synthetic experiments to test the individual effect of these phenomena
             on a population of simulated organisms. We developed an evolutionary
             model - aevol - in which evolutionary conditions can be changed one
             at a time to test their effects on genome size and organization (e.g.
             coding ratio). To illustrate the proposed approach, we used aevol to
            test the effects of a strong reduction in the selection strength on
            a population of (simulated) bacteria. Our results show that this
            reduction of selection strength leads to a genome reduction of ~35%
            with a slight loss of coding sequences (~15% of the genes are lost -
            mainly those for which the contribution to fitness is the lowest).
            More surprisingly, under a low selection strength, genomes undergo a
            strong reduction of the noncoding compartment (~55% of the noncoding
            sequences being lost). These results are consistent with what is
            observed in reduced <i>Prochlorococcus</i> strains (marine cyanobacteria)
            when compared to close relatives.

        summary: >
            Nowadays, massive amounts of diverse data are generated in biomedical research. 
            To manage it and extract useful information, bioinformatic solutions are needed and 
            softwares must be developed. The development of a tool should always follow a similar 
            process. First, to solve a scientific question or a need, some source code is developed, 
            that can be distributed as it is. To help its deployment and ease the usage of the tools, 
            the code is packaged in various package formats. The tool behind the code is then deployed 
            and used by the targeted users. Ideally, documentation, training and support are also provided 
            to help users, spread the solution and advertise it.

            This process, from development to support, is the golden path to develop a good tool. But issues for deployment and 
            sustainability of the tool are found for many bioinformatic tools. What bioinformatician has not dealt with the 
            situation of missing tool dependencies, or an older version of a tool could not be installed due to various reasons. 
            Deployment and sustainability of tools are therefore a major issue for productivity and reproducibility in science.
            
            For deployment issues, we need a package manager that is OS and programming language agnostic, as bioinformatic tools 
            are developed in mostly all available languages and can be used on every major operating systems, including ancient ones. 
            Moreover all available packages have to be permanently cached to be always reachable and enable reproducibility.
            
            Here we describe a community effort to create a flexible, scalable and sustainable system to fix the tool deployment 
            problem once and for all.
            
            Bioconda is a distribution of bioinformatics softwares using Conda, an open source package manager, independent of any 
            programming language and OS. Installation of conda packages are fast and robust. No root privileges are required and 
            multiple versions of every software can be installed and managed in parallel. Helped by an extensive documentation, writing 
            a conda package is very simple, easing the contribution. Thanks to its big and fast-growing community, more than 1,500 bioinformatic 
            packages have been developed in last year. These packages are long-term stored in a public repository (Cargo Port), the distribution 
            center of the Galaxy Project, resolving the sustainability issue. Moreover, a technique called layer donning has been recently 
            introduced to build Docker containers automatically and very efficiently for all conda package.
            
            Development of conda packages through the Bioconda community eases the packaging and the deployment of any bioinformatic tool. 
            The interface with Cargo Port enables sustainability by mirroring all sources. Building efficient Linux containers automatically 
            ensures an even higher layer of abstraction and isolation of the base system. Thanks to these collaborative projects, their 
            community and their collaborations, bioinformatics tools can be easily packaged, deployed and will be always available to help 
            biomedical research.

            Metatranscriptomic data allow active microbial communities description
            by gene products analysis. In comparison to
            metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on
            environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated
            microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in
            RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data
            processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics
            analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible.
            Here we present ASAIM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis for Intestinal Microbiota),
            a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota.
            Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments
            using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more
            and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like MetaHIT and HMP projects
            for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate
            assignments. Finally, ASAIM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance
            information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This
            pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing
            given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and
            tutorials. ASAIM is freely available at
            <a href="http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/">http://g2im.u-clermont1.fr/asaim/</a> and
            can be downloaded or directly interrogated through its web interface.

        summary: >
            The emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria is a major threat to
            public health and there is a constant need for education to limit
            dangerous practices. Here, we propose to use alife software to develop
            training media for the public and the physicians. On the basis of the
             Aevol model we have been developing for more than six years, we built
             a game in which players fight bacterial infections using antibiotics.
             In this game the bacteria can evolve resistance traits, making the
             infection more and more difficult to cure. The game has been tested
             with automatic treatment procedures, showing that it behaves correctly.
             It has been demonstrated during the French "Nuit des Chercheurs" in
             October 2012.

        summary: >
            Given a popular view, evolution is an incremental process based on an
            increase of molecular complexity of organisms. However, some organisms
            have undergo massive genome reduction like the endosymbionts. In this
            case the reduction can be explained by the Muller’s ratchet due to the
            endosymbiont lifestyle with small population and lack of recombination.
            However, in some marine bacteria, like <i>Prochlorococcus</i> et <i>Pelagibacter</i>,
            lineage have undergo up to 30% of genome reduction. Their lifestyle is
            almost the opposite to the one of the endosymbionts and reductive genome
            evolution can not be easily explicable by the Muller’s ratchet. Some other
            hypothesis has been proposed but none can explain all the observed genomic
             characteristics. In the thesis, I am interested in the reductive
             evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. I used two approaches: a theoretical
             one using simulation where different scenarios are tested and an analysis
             of <i>Prochlorococcus</i> genomes in a phylogenetic framework to determine
             the causes and characteristics of genome reduction. The combination
             of these two approaches allows to propose an hypothetical evolutive
             history for the reductive genome evolution of <i>Prochlorococcus</i>.

            Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) are ubiquitous persistent
            pollutants arising from oil and derivatives along with incomplete
            organic matter combustion. The latter including both anthropogenic
            (engine exhausts, domestic heating, tobacco smoke, some cooking
            practices) and natural sources (forest fires, volcanism). Population
            exposure occurs mainly with contaminated food products, leading
            pollutants to end up in the digestive tract. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P),
            being the most studied PAH due to its high mutagenic and carcinogenic
            properties, has been chosen as marker of PAH occurrence and toxicity.
            While its metabolism by host cells is well known, the impact on the
            gut microbiota, which play a key role in human health is still
            unexplored. By means of 16S barcoding, metatranscriptomics and
            volatile metabolomics, we studied, in an in vitro model assay, the
            impact of B[a]P on two distinct gut microbiota. B[a]P didn’t induce
            a significant change of the microbial structure but some slight
            modifications appeared as the increase of the genera Sutterella,
            Sporanaerobacter and Oscillospira and the reduction of Rikenellaceae
            and Blautia. B[a]P exposure alters the microbial volatile metabolome
            dose-dependently. While the two studied microbiota structures were
            clearly apart, their metabolic response was rather similar.
            Metatranscriptomes revealed that several functional pathways were up
            regulated such as DNA repair systems, cell wall compound biogenesis
            and vitamins and cofactors metabolism and others down regulated as
            the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis pathway and the bacterial chemotaxis
            towards simple carbohydrates. Those primary findings shows that food
            pollutants, such as B[a]P, may interfere with the human gut
            microbiota activity. This interplay should then be highlighted to
            understand if such changes are related to gut homeostasis maintenance
            in a protective response against chemical pollutants or could
            contribute to functional dysbiosis in relation to pathologies.

            didn’t shift significantly the microbial structure but some trends appeared
            as the increase of the genra <i>Sutterella</i>, <i>Sporanaerobacter</i> and <i>Oscillospira</i>
            and the reduction of <i>Rikenellaceae</i> and <i>Blautia</i>. Some functional pathways
            were heighten such as protein export, secretion systems, cell wall compound
            biogenesis, DNA repair systems and hydrocarbon degradation pathways.
            Furthermore, the microbial volatile metabolome was altered. Those primary
            findings showed that food pollutants, such as B[a]P, may modify our gut
            microbiota and could contribute to disturb the gut homeostasis.

            Genome architecture (size, proportion of coding sequences, polycistronic
            mRNAs…) is the consequence of many interacting forces acting over very
             long time scales. Indeed, selection, mutation biases, drift etc. all
             act directly or indirectly on the different genome compartments, either
             triggering their increase or decrease in proportions that depend on the
            life style of the organisms (e.g., environment complexity, environment
            variation, population size…).
            Understanding how the intertwining of these pressures leads to particular
            architecture is difficult for at least three reasons. First, it is
            impossible to experimentally separate these forces to observe their
            individual action since they are all interacting one with the others
            at the molecular level. Second, they act on time scales that are almost
            impossible to access experimentally, even with species reproducing rapidly.
            Third, it is not clear how a given change of life-style will affect
            these different pressures.
            We propose that <i>in silico</i> experimental evolution approaches, in which
            simulated species are let evolved in perfectly controlled (simulated)
            environments, can be used to study the consequences of a specific change
            in life-style on the genome architecture. Indeed, <i>in silico</i> experiments
            can escape most of the difficulties listed above: since the organisms
            and environment are simulated, they can be precisely tuned, millions of
             generations can “easily” be simulated and, most importantly, it allows
            large parameter explorations that can help understanding the precise
            effect of a given environmental parameter on a given genomic structure.
            We illustrate the power of in silico experimental evolution using the
            aevol software (<a href="www.aevol.fr">www.aevol.fr</a>). We show how different environmental
            changes can lead to unexpected consequences on the genome structure
            due to the non-linearity of the selective/non-selective pressures. In
            particular, we emphasize the overlooked effect of chromosomal rearrangements
            on this matter.

        title: "Simulating evolutionary scenarios to test whether they can induced reductive evolution"

            Some bacterial lineages seem to have undergone significant genome shrinkage
            over the last millions of years, a process called reductive evolution.
            For example, the genome of <i>Buchnera aphidicola</i> is only one-seventh
            the size of the genome of its close relative <i>Escherichia coli</i>
            (Moran and Mira, Genome Biol. 2001). This reductive evolution was initially
             thought to be a signature of intracellular lifestyle. Thus, explanatory
            mechanisms related to this lifestyle were proposed, like a smaller
            effective population size, a lower exposure to horizontal transfer,
            or the uselessness of some genes. However, reduced genomes were also
            found in some free-living cyanobacteria like <i>Prochlorococcus marinus</i>
            (Rocap et al., Nature 2003) or <i>Pelagibacter ubique</i> (Giovannoni
            et al., Science 2005). This questions the evolutionary mechanisms underlying
             reductive evolution: Are they shared by endosymbionts and cyanobacteria?
            Predicting the effect of these mechanisms would shed light on the minimal
            combination of factors required to observe reductive evolution. We performed
            <i>in silico</i> evolutionary experiments to test the effect of a smaller
            population size, a higher mutation rate, a less demanding environment,
            and a less varying environment. We used the individual-based model aevol
            (Knibbe et al., Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007), where virtual genomes undergo
            small-scale mutations, rearrangements, and reproduce differentially
            based on their performance at a curve-fitting task. Experiments began
            with ancestral populations that evolved with standard parameters during
            150,000 generations. Then the value of the tested parameter was changed
            and evolution continued for 150,000 additional generations. These simulations
             showed that a higher mutation rate, as well as a less demanding environment,
             led to both fewer genes and shorter intergenic sequences. Environmental
            stabilization triggered reduction in non-coding sequences but not in gene
            number. Finally, with a smaller population size, some genes were lost
            but the genome expanded because intergenic sequences lengthened, even
            with an enforced deletional bias. To explain this surprising effect,
            one hypothesis is that the sudden reduction in population size leaves
            a less fit population. The selection, now directional, indirectly favors
             the most evolvable genomes, that is, genomes with longer non-coding
             sequences undergoing larger rearrangements. This study is thus a first
            step towards predicting the genome structure expected for a given evolutionary
            scenario. The next steps are to (i) further analyze the evolutionary
            trajectories in these experiments, (ii) test the effect of combined
            scenarii with multiple changed parameters, and (iii) find the best scenarii
            for intracellular and free-living species with reduced genomes.
