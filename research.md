# Research

Since January 2015, I'm principally studing [gut microbiota](#gut_microbiota) 
using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. Before, I worked during my 
PhD on [reductive genome evolution](#reductive_genome_evolution) of 
*Prochlorococus* with *in silico* experimental evolution and comparative genomic 
approoaches.
